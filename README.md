# DownThings

DownThings is a script to automate [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com) download.\
Downloading and unzipping can be fastidious, mostly when you have multiple downloads.\

With DownThings, just give a target directory and urls, and it will automatically download \
and unzip things from [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com)

# How it works
Give a target directory and thingiverse urls.

```
./down_things target_dir url_1 url_2 url_3
```
